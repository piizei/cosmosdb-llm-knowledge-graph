    "## 1. Overview\n",
    "You are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\n",
    "- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts. They're akin to Wikipedia nodes.\n",
    "- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it accessible for a vast audience.\n",
    "## 2. Labeling Nodes\n",
    "- **Consistency**: Ensure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\n",
    "  - For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **\"person\"**. Avoid using more specific terms like \"mathematician\" or \"scientist\".\n",
    "- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\n",
    "## 3. Handling Numerical Data and Dates\n",
    "- Numerical data, like age or other related information, should be incorporated as attributes or properties of the respective nodes.\n",
    "- **No Separate Nodes for Dates/Numbers**: Do not create separate nodes for dates or numerical values. Always attach them as attributes or properties of nodes.\n",
    "- **Property Format**: Properties must be in a key-value format.\n",
    "- **Quotation Marks**: Never use escaped single or double quotes within property values.\n",
    "- **Naming Convention**: Use camelCase for property keys, e.g., `birthDate`.\n",
    "## 4. Coreference Resolution\n",
    "- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\n",
    "If an entity, such as \"John Doe\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \"Joe\", \"he\"),\n",
    "always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \"John Doe\" as the entity ID.\n",
    "Remember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\n",
    "## 5. Strict Compliance\n",
    "Adhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\n",
    "*Double check* that the JSON structure is correct.\n",

At the same time, different breeds tend to also \\nhave certain characteristics that help define that particular breed. This information can be helpful to you \\nwhen you are choosing a  dog or trying to understand his  behavior.  \\n \\nThe AKC (American Kennel Club) places dog breeds within seven different groups. In order to ac count for \\nthe different behaviors within a particular group, some groups can be further subdivided into families.  \\n \\nHerding group:  \\nBreeds in this group were bred to herd sheep and cattle. They do this by stalking and staring, barking \\nand/or nipping at their  charges. They are bred to be intelli gent, athletic and diligent and  they are very \\ntrainable. Dogs from this group will do best with lots of exercise. They do even better if they have a job \\nsuch as agility where they can use their natural athletic ability to navigate an agility course. Barking can be \\na problem if they are bored and they may attempt to “herd” their people -pack by nipping and chasing.  \\n \\nCharacteristics : \\n\\uf0b7 Alert  \\n\\uf0b7 Smart  \\n\\uf0b7 Independent  \\n\\uf0b7 Confident  \\n\\uf0b7 Trainable  \\n\\uf0b7 Loyal  \\n\\uf0b7 Affectionate  \\n Herding breeds : \\n\\uf0b7 Collies  \\n\\uf0b7 Sheepdogs  \\n\\uf0b7 Cattle dogs  \\n\\uf0b7 Corgis  \\n\\uf0b7 Shepherds  \\n\\uf0b7 Belgian Malinois  \\n\\uf0b7 Belgian Tervuren  \\n \\n \\n  \\n'), (1, 1625, ' \\n  \\n Behavior & Training  \\n 415.506.6 280 \\n Available B&T Services  \\n \\n \\n171 Bel Marin Keys Blvd., Novato, CA  94949    Dog Breed Characteristics & Behavior  \\nLike us at :   Page 2 of 7 \\nHound group : \\nHounds were originally bred to hunt. Though not used to hunt as much now, the instinct is still strong in \\nthem. They will have a strong prey drive and will want to chase down small animals. Sighthounds can run \\nforever and need off leash opportunities in sa fe, enclosed areas.  \\n \\nCharacteristics : \\n\\uf0b7 Independent  \\n\\uf0b7 Sweet  \\n\\uf0b7 Intelligent  \\n\\uf0b7 Affectionate  \\n \\nFamilies within the hound group : \\nSight hounds : Sight hounds were bred to find and chase down larger animals such as deer and elk. \\nSight hounds are long and lean  and have excellent vision . \\nSighthounds can  run for a long stretch, but they are basically \\nsprinters . They run until they catch their prey,  and then stop \\nfor a rest . In many parts of the world sighthounds are still used \\nto hunt . They may not be interested in obedience work and can \\nbe hard to train.   \\n \\n• Afghan  \\n• Saluki  \\n• Ibizan  \\n• Pharoah  \\n• Greyhound  \\n• Whippet  \\n• Italian Greyhound  \\n• Rhodesian Ridgeback (a sight & scent hound )  \\n \\nScent hounds : Scent hounds are usually smaller than the sight hounds. They were bred to chase \\nsmaller prey to the ground. They have an incredible sense of smell and they typically have long ears. \\nBloodhounds and Bassets have ears that can scrape the ground when they are sniffing, and so stir up \\neven more smells. Scent hounds are forever in search o f a scent and will run away from you if a scent \\nbeckons.  \\n• Beagle  \\n• Basset Hound  \\n• Bloodhound  \\n• Otterhound  \\n• Fox Hounds  \\n \\n  \\n'), (2, 3309, ' \\n  \\n Behavior & Training  \\n 415.506.6 280 \\n Available B&T Services  \\n \\n \\n171 Bel Marin Keys Blvd., Novato, CA  94949    Dog Breed Characteristics & Behavior  \\nLike us at :   Page 3 of 7 \\nNon -Sporting Group : \\nThis is the fastest growing group and the dogs in it range  in terms of size, shape, colors, coat types, etc. \\nThey are often  dogs  who  no longer perform the duties for which they were originally bred. For example, \\nthe Dalmatian no longer accompanies carriages, the Bulldog is no longer a bull baiter and the Poodle is no \\nlonger a water -hunting dog. Their temperaments are as varied  as their looks. This is the group where many \\nof our “companion” animals come from.  \\n \\nCharacteristics : \\n\\uf0b7 Playful  \\n\\uf0b7 Smart  \\n\\uf0b7 Curious  \\n\\uf0b7 Friendly  \\n\\uf0b7 Loyal  \\n\\uf0b7 Eager  \\n Non sporting breeds : \\n\\uf0b7 American Eskimo  \\n\\uf0b7 Boston Terrier  \\n\\uf0b7 Bulldogs  \\n\\uf0b7 Shar -Pei \\n\\uf0b7 Chow Chow  \\n\\uf0b7 Dalmation  \\n\\uf0b7 Keeshond  \\n\\uf0b7 Poodle  \\n\\uf0b7 Shiba -Inu \\n\\uf0b7 Lhasa Apso  \\n\\uf0b7 Tibetan Terrier  \\n \\nSporting group:  \\nThese dogs were originally bred to assist hunters in finding, pointing, flushing and retrieving game. Many \\nstill perform those jobs for hunters . They are loyal and trainable. The se dogs can also be successful  therapy \\ndogs, assistance dogs and search/rescue dogs. They are generally very athletic, active and strong and will \\nneed plenty of exercise, and maybe even a job such as agility or fly ball. If these dogs don’t g et adequate \\ndaily exercise they can become frustrated and destructive.  \\n \\nCharacteristics : \\n\\uf0b7 Happy  \\n\\uf0b7 Eager  \\n\\uf0b7 Trainable  \\uf0b7 Bright  \\n\\uf0b7 Friendly  \\uf0b7 Confident  \\n\\uf0b7 Lovable  \\n \\nFamilies within the sporting group : \\nRetrievers : Retrievers are trained to go and get “it” and bring “it” back. “It” can be on land or in the \\nwater.

These dogs are typically energetic and fun loving and will love the game of fetch . \\nNote : Some strains of Cocker and Springer Spaniel develop a behavior problem known as “rage \\nsyndrome .” It is thought to be a form of dominant aggression or conflict behavior.

Tenacious and determined to \\ncatch their prey, they will also burrow into the ground \\nafter them. Some of the terriers were bred to kill rats in \\npit contests, and later to fight each other.

Many are used in breeding Wol f Hybrids. \\nA working Malamute can pull up to a ton of material a short distance and Huskies can travel pulling a \\nloaded sled for many miles. Samoyeds are also sled dogs and the small \\nsized American Eskimos are sled dogs who  have been bred down to a \\nsmaller  size.
