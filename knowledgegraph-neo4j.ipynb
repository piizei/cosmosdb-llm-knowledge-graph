    "## 1. Overview\n",
    "You are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\n",
    "- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts. They're akin to Wikipedia nodes.\n",
    "- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it accessible for a vast audience.\n",
    "## 2. Labeling Nodes\n",
    "- **Consistency**: Ensure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\n",
    "  - For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **\"person\"**. Avoid using more specific terms like \"mathematician\" or \"scientist\".\n",
    "- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\n",
    "## 3. Handling Numerical Data and Dates\n",
    "- Numerical data, like age or other related information, should be incorporated as attributes or properties of the respective nodes.\n",
    "- **No Separate Nodes for Dates/Numbers**: Do not create separate nodes for dates or numerical values. Always attach them as attributes or properties of nodes.\n",
    "- **Property Format**: Properties must be in a key-value format.\n",
    "- **Quotation Marks**: Never use escaped single or double quotes within property values.\n",
    "- **Naming Convention**: Use camelCase for property keys, e.g., `birthDate`.\n",
    "## 4. Coreference Resolution\n",
    "- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\n",
    "If an entity, such as \"John Doe\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \"Joe\", \"he\"),\n",
    "always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \"John Doe\" as the entity ID.\n",
    "Remember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\n",
    "## 5. Strict Compliance\n",
    "Adhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\n",
    "*Double check* that the JSON structure is correct.\n",

At the same time, different breeds tend to also \\nhave certain characteristics that help define that particular breed. This information can be helpful to you \\nwhen you are choosing a  dog or trying to understand his  behavior.  \\n \\nThe AKC (American Kennel Club) places dog breeds within seven different groups. In order to ac count for \\nthe different behaviors within a particular group, some groups can be further subdivided into families.  \\n \\nHerding group:  \\nBreeds in this group were bred to herd sheep and cattle. They do this by stalking and staring, barking \\nand/or nipping at their  charges. They are bred to be intelli gent, athletic and diligent and  they are very \\ntrainable. Dogs from this group will do best with lots of exercise. They do even better if they have a job \\nsuch as agility where they can use their natural athletic ability to navigate an agility course. Barking can be \\na problem if they are bored and they may attempt to “herd” their people -pack by nipping and chasing.  \\n \\nCharacteristics : \\n\\uf0b7 Alert  \\n\\uf0b7 Smart  \\n\\uf0b7 Independent  \\n\\uf0b7 Confident  \\n\\uf0b7 Trainable  \\n\\uf0b7 Loyal  \\n\\uf0b7 Affectionate  \\n Herding breeds : \\n\\uf0b7 Collies  \\n\\uf0b7 Sheepdogs  \\n\\uf0b7 Cattle dogs  \\n\\uf0b7 Corgis  \\n\\uf0b7 Shepherds  \\n\\uf0b7 Belgian Malinois  \\n\\uf0b7 Belgian Tervuren  \\n \\n \\n  \\n'), (1, 1625, ' \\n  \\n Behavior & Training  \\n 415.506.6 280 \\n Available B&T Services  \\n \\n \\n171 Bel Marin Keys Blvd., Novato, CA  94949    Dog Breed Characteristics & Behavior  \\nLike us at :   Page 2 of 7 \\nHound group : \\nHounds were originally bred to hunt.

For example, \\nthe Dalmatian no longer accompanies carriages, the Bulldog is no longer a bull baiter and the Poodle is no \\nlonger a water -hunting dog. Their temperaments are as varied  as their looks.

Many \\nstill perform those jobs for hunters . They are loyal and trainable. The se dogs can also be successful  therapy \\ndogs, assistance dogs and search/rescue dogs. They are generally very athletic, active and strong and will \\nneed plenty of exercise, and maybe even a job such as agility or fly ball. If these dogs don’t g et adequate \\ndaily exercise they can become frustrated and destructive.  \\n \\nCharacteristics : \\n\\uf0b7 Happy  \\n\\uf0b7 Eager  \\n\\uf0b7 Trainable  \\uf0b7 Bright  \\n\\uf0b7 Friendly  \\uf0b7 Confident  \\n\\uf0b7 Lovable  \\n \\nFamilies within the sporting group : \\nRetrievers : Retrievers are trained to go and get “it” and bring “it” back. “It” can be on land or in the \\nwater.

These dogs are typically energetic and fun loving and will love the game of fetch . \\nNote : Some strains of Cocker and Springer Spaniel develop a behavior problem known as “rage \\nsyndrome .” It is thought to be a form of dominant aggression or conflict behavior.

Tenacious and determined to \\ncatch their prey, they will also burrow into the ground \\nafter them. Some of the terriers were bred to kill rats in \\npit contests, and later to fight each other.

Many are used in breeding Wol f Hybrids. \\nA working Malamute can pull up to a ton of material a short distance and Huskies can travel pulling a \\nloaded sled for many miles. Samoyeds are also sled dogs and the small \\nsized American Eskimos are sled dogs who  have been bred down to a \\nsmaller  size.
